	<h1> What is the Inclusion Counsel </h1>
	<p>In response to a growing awareness of the need to support underrepresented communities in finance, ECMG launched the Inclusion Council in the summer of 2020. This council was founded in order to create a more diverse and equitable environment within the organization. One of the defining goals of ECMG is to be an equal opportunity student-run organization that delivers a high standard of financial knowledge to its members and the community it operates in. At the Inclusion Council, we work together to forward this objective by improving recruitment practices, imbuing a more inclusive culture into the organizationâ€™s processes and activities, and ensuring the delivery of financial education to the larger community.
